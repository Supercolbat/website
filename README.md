## Q/A

### Why Rust?

I've recently picked up Rust, and this website was a great excuse to practice. My main goals for this
website are for it to be server-side rendered (SSR), not require JavaScript to be enabled, and to be
visually pleasing on many screen sizes. A non-goal is for it to be widely accessible. A goal that I
will not have is to making the CSS work on old browsers. I *will* abuse modern CSS.

## How to set up?

Although this is my website, by using the power of MIT License, I grant you the power to use my
website (and my code).

Step 1: Clone the repository

Step 2: `cargo run --release`

Step 3: For now, that's it.
